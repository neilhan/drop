# Five monkeys

Five monkeys locked in a cage. 

Hang a banana from the roof on a string and place a set of stairs under it. 

The monkeys will start to climb toward the banana. 

Once a monkey touches the stairs, hose the other monkeys with cold water. 

If another monkey makes an attempt with the same result. All the other are sprayed with cold water. 

Soon monkeys will try prevent anyone to try again. 

Now, replace a monkey with a new one. The new monkey sees the banana and climbs the stairs. 
All the other monkeys attack him. After another attempt and attack, 
he knows that if he tries to climb the stairs, he will be assaulted. 

Next, replace another monkey with a new one. The newcomer goes to the stairs and is attacked. 
The previous newcomer takes part in the punishment with enthusiasm! 

Likewise, replace a third original monkey with a new one, then a fourth, then the fifth. 
Every time the newest monkey takes to the stairs, he is attacked. 

After replacing all the original monkeys, none of the remaining monkeys have ever been sprayed with cold water. 
None of the monkeys have any idea why they shouldn't climb the stairs, and why they are beating the newest monkey. 

Nevertheless, no monkey ever again approaches the stairs to try for the banana. 

Because as far as they know *that's the way things are done around here.*
