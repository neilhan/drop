# Learning path for ML, DL, RL, and recommendation

20170522

This is a record of my learning.

Much of our future is related to AI. It's time to understand and apply current AI to engineering problems.


[Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) - Andrew Ng

[Recommender System course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/recommender-systems/home/welcome)

[Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks) - Geoffrey Hinton, University of Toronto

[Reinforcement Learning](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud600/lessons/4676850295/concepts/46733448110923)

[Deep learning on Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud730/lessons/6370362152/concepts/63798118150923), this is a hands-on course. I am in the middle of this course.

I needed a refresher on statistics:
Basic Statistics - Matthijs Rooduijn, Emiel van Loon,  University of Amsterdam

When learn a new thing, I prefer knowing thoroughly. After going through the courses, I found books give me more confidence.

"Introduction to Machine Learning" by Ethem Alpaydin. This book is highly recommended.

"Recommender Systems Handbook" by Francesco Ricci, Lior Rokach etc. It's a recommender system bible.

"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow. I am not able to go through this book yet. But it's been recommended by many.

"[Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~straka/courses/npfl114/2016/sutton-bookdraft2016sep.pdf)" by Sutton, Barto

I have also been getting my next steps by looking at this Quora answer. "[How do I learn deep learning in 2 months?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-deep-learning-in-2-months)"
